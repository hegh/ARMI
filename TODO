TODO:
 * Get rid of AbstractParser.magicallyDeliciousObject(), as it is really really bad
   (it bypasses Java access controls to call java.io.ObjectStreamClass.newInstance(),
   which has default visibility). Need to find a way to duplicate the rest of
   ObjectStreamClass to make it work correctly, without violating any license terms
   or other access controls.

 * Add test cases for the Client- and Server-side socket communicators, now that
   they are in the core library.
